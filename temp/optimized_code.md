## Optimizing the `twoSum` function for Energy Efficiency

While JavaScript code optimization for energy efficiency is not a primary concern in most cases, improving the algorithm's time complexity indirectly translates to lower energy consumption. Here's how we can optimize the provided code:

**1. Objective and Variables:**

* **Objective:** Find the indices of two numbers in an array that add up to a given target value.
* **Variables:**
    * `nums`: Input array of numbers.
    * `target`: The target sum.
    * `n`: Length of the input array.
    * `i`, `j`: Loop counters.

**2. Optimizing Algorithm Architecture:**

The current code uses a nested loop, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity. We can significantly improve this by using a hash table (object in JavaScript):

```javascript
function twoSumOptimized(nums, target) {
  const seenNumbers = {};

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];

    if (complement in seenNumbers) {
      return [seenNumbers[complement], i];
    }

    seenNumbers[nums[i]] = i;
  }

  return [];
}

const result = twoSumOptimized([2, 7, 11, 15], 9);
console.log(result); // Output: [0, 1]
```

**Explanation:**

* We create an empty object `seenNumbers` to store encountered numbers and their indices.
* We iterate through the `nums` array only once.
* For each number, we calculate its `complement` (the number needed to reach the `target`).
* We check if the `complement` is already present as a key in `seenNumbers`. 
    * If yes, we found the pair and return the indices. 
    * If not, we add the current number and its index to `seenNumbers`.

**3. Assessing Data Outlier Probabilities:**

While not directly related to energy efficiency, considering outlier probabilities can further optimize specific scenarios:

* **Sorted Input:** If the input array is sorted, we can utilize two-pointer techniques for O(n) time complexity.
* **Sparse Data:** If the array contains many duplicate values or a large range with few distinct elements, analyzing the data distribution beforehand might reveal optimization opportunities.

**Energy Efficiency Improvements:**

* **Reduced Time Complexity:** The optimized code has O(n) time complexity compared to the original O(n^2). This means significantly fewer operations, especially for large arrays, leading to lower energy consumption.
* **Reduced Memory Access:** Hash table lookups (using `in` operator) are generally faster than nested loop iterations, further contributing to energy efficiency.

**Note:** 

While these optimizations significantly improve performance and indirectly reduce energy consumption, actual energy savings might be minuscule for small input sizes. These optimizations primarily target improving the algorithm's efficiency for scalability and larger datasets.
